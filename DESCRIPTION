Description: A package was created within a masters thesis 'Epidemic models
    based on stochastic processes' at the Masaryk University in the Czech 
    Republic. It contains three functions for generating from an SIR, SEIR and
    ... epidemic model respectively, three functions performing the standard ABC
    algorithm (one for each model) and three functions performing the MCMC-ABC
    (one for each model). The key premise is, that the epidemic data consist
    of equidistant discrete observations of numbers of new cases, e.g. per day,
    per week...
